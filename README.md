ALAB 320H.9.1 - Building a Todo List

-Learning Objectives
-After completing this lab, learners will have demonstrated the ability to:

-Use the useReducer and/or useImmerReducer hook to manage state with reducer functions.
-Use useState in places where reducers are not appropriate or necessary.
-Implement controlled forms and inputs.
-Effectively decide where pieces of state should live.
-Use conditional rendering and conditional styling to provide a positive, interactive user experience.
-Create a complete React application from a set of desired functionality.
-A heading labeling it as a "todo list."
-A list of "todo" items, which are strings listing activities to be accomplished (e.g. "find that missing sock"). Each "todo" item  should   have:

-A checkbox next to it which indicates whether it is "complete."
-A "delete" button next to it which removes it from the list.

-The "delete" button should be disabled unless the todo is complete!
-An "edit" button that replaces the todo string with a text input used to edit the todo.
